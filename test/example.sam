section: The Status Quo

	section: Foundational Concepts

		There are a lot of different things that people believe about how the world works. Most of 
		the time, people get stuck arguing about those beliefs without realizing that nearly all 
		ideas are built on top of other ideas, and that some ideas are more foundational than 
		others. In modern society, the realm of politics is generally where we discuss some of the 
		most foundational beliefs we all hold, on topics like work ethic, patriotism, education, or 
		immigration. However, these political battleground topics are not philosophical 
		foundations; they are built on even more layers that get deeper into existential questions.

	section: Religious Foundations

		In {Competitive Individualism}(em) (the dominant philosophical framework), one of the most 
		foundational stories is that living things are separated from non-living things, and that 
		human beings are the most advanced living organism, uniquely having the gift of thought, 
		rational decision making, and perhaps even the spark of a soul.

		In order for this idea to hold weight, it needs to stand on something more concrete and 
		unquestionable. Historically, the backing for this idea comes from religious traditions, in 
		which humanity was created in the image of God(s), being given special abilities to mark 
		our special status as God's children.

		section:(class="status-quo") Human Divinity
			x-field: Religion
			x-field: Theology
			x-definition:

				Human beings were created by God(s). Humans were created in the image of the 
				divine, and given special capability and status in the world based on their 
				relationship to the creator(s). Humans are separate and special from other living 
				creatures.

		From the present day it's easy to see how this idea developed, and it's core flaw in 
		reasoning: it was created by starting with its premise ("we must be special") and then 
		working backwards to justify that somehow. Early humans were sentient animals that 
		developed advanced cognition and stumbled upon the same questions we're asking here, so 
		over time they developed stories and traditions (religions) that answered their existential 
		questions.

	section: Scientific Foundations

		In the modern day, scientific inquiry has given us new information about the mechanics of 
		the universe, which has started to dismantle the old religious traditions' influence.

		That brings us to our modern scientific understanding of humanity's role in the universe. 
		At some point early on in our biology education, we learn about the hierarchy of life.

		section:(class="status-quo") Hierarchy of Life
			x-field: Philosophy
			x-field: Biology
			x-definition:

				Organisms—like human beings—are at the top of a hierarchy. Organisms are made up of 
				organs (like the brain, heart, and lungs for humans), and those organs are made up 
				of tissues. Tissues are composed of cells, and cells are composed of organelles 
				like the mitochondria and nucleus. Organelles are built out of molecules, molecules 
				are built out of atoms, and atoms have components like electrons, protons, and 
				neutrons.

				The organisms at the top of the hierarchy are the individual plants and animals 
				that exist and make changes in the world.

		However, our scientific knowledge didn't develop all at once: new concepts emerge in small 
		bits and pieces based off of the constantly growing body of past research. As science 
		advanced, each new scientific understanding was made within the context of those religious 
		foundations. So in practice, each small scientific discovery could slowly be absorbed into 
		and reframed by the dominant worldview ("Human Divinity"). This isn't a flaw in the science 
		itself, but in our interpretation of those facts.

		Once again, this means our conclusion was reached backwards, just like the religious 
		foundations. We started with the current assumption ("Humans are Divine and Special") and 
		worked backwards to fit scientific concepts to match that story. If we were to rebuild our 
		entire foundation from scratch with everything we know now, we might end up with a 
		different story...

	section: Human Exceptionalism

		We've now looked at two different existential foundations, though both produce the same 
		answer to the question {"Are humans special among living things?".}(strong) Whether through 
		divinity bestowed by God or by being at the top of a biological hierarchy, both 
		interpretations answer with humans being in a position of prominence and dominance within 
		the natural world.

				section:(class="status-quo") Human Exceptionalism
					x-field: Competitive Individualism
					x-definition:

						Human beings are unique and separate from the rest of the natural world,
						whether through their religious connection to a deity, position at the
						top of the biological hierarchy, or their distinct intellect and capacity
						for scientific reasoning.

		Human exceptionalism is the foundation that western society (and {Competitive 
		Individualism}(em)) is built on. It's important to realize that, regardless of if you buy 
		into this idea by itself, it informs many of our institutions, laws, and cultural norms. 
		It's impossible to engage in modern society without interacting with this principle on a 
		daily basis. We'll spend the rest of the article revisiting some key scientific concepts 
		from the last hundred years that will help us assess this foundation, and ultimately build 
		a new one.
