		article: Semantic Authoring Markdown

			This is a cute little post about writing in Semantic Authoring Markdown. 
			You can write little paragraphs like this, and add {annotations}(em) like 
			that. A "block" starts with `tag-name:`, followed by attributes in 
			parenthesis. After the block definition is a flow that can be annotated. 
			A flow without an explicit block definition (like this one) is assumed to be a 
			paragraph. Paragraphs end with a blank line.

			You can also have built in support for ordered and unordered lists:

			1. First item
			2. Second item
			3. Third item

			* Some item
				1. Some nested numbered item
				2. Some second nested numbered item
			* Some other item
			* Some more items
			* Even more items
				* Yet another nested item

			pre:
				```
				Literal text can be specified like this, and now we can put all sorts of 
				normally illegal symbols in here, like source code.

				( routines )
				: decrement-return ( n --r-- n-1 )
					~unstash8
					~decrement8
					~stash8
				;

				No problems!
				```

			You can also nest multiple annotations {like this}(em)(strong), and even give 
			annotations attributes {like this}(a|href="https://website.com").

			And that's basically it for now.
